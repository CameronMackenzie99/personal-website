			<p class="text-muted-foreground mt-4 max-w-[600px] text-xl">
				I am a full-stack engineer with a varied background, having entered the tech industry after completing a master's degree in chemistry.
			</p>
			<p class="text-muted-foreground mt-4 max-w-[600px] text-xl">
				I'm really interested in end-to-end and integration testing, and how it can be used to improve website accessibility and reliability. I believe that with the right tooling these tests can increase confidence in changes and improve maintainability. Tools such as react testing library, mock service worker and Playwright are good examples of tools I enjoy using to achieve this.

				I love spending my free time cooking interesting food, exploring places, and indoor (hopefully one day outdoor) bouldering!
