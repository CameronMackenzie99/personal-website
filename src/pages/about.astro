          I am a full-stack engineer with a varied background, having entered
          the tech industry after completing a master's degree in chemistry. I'm
          working at Urban Jungle as a <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>, shipping
          new products and leading on new features.

        <p class="text-muted-foreground mt-4 max-w-[600px] text-xl">
          I'm really interested in shipping things that matter to users, and
          backing up this functionality with good testing that doesn't cost the
          earth to maintain. I love working in a team that shares these values,
          mentoring and learning from colleagues with this in mind. Teaching
          others is the fastest way to learn something new!
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted-foreground mt-4 max-w-[600px] text-xl">
          I love spending my free time cooking interesting food, exploring
          places with family and friends, and indoor (hopefully one day outdoor)
          bouldering!
