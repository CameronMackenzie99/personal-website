          I am a full-stack engineer with a varied background, having entered
          the tech industry after completing a master's degree in chemistry.

          I'm really interested in end-to-end and integration testing, and how
          it can be used to improve website accessibility and reliability. I
          believe that with the right tooling these tests can increase
          confidence in changes and improve maintainability. Tools such as react
          testing library, mock service worker and Playwright are good examples
          of tools I enjoy using to achieve this.

          I love spending my free time cooking interesting food, exploring
          places, and indoor (hopefully one day outdoor) bouldering!
